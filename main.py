    Welcome to the Leaf Disease Classification System! üåøüîç

     **Especially For Tomato Plants**

    Our mission is to help in identifying plant diseases efficiently. Upload an image of a plant, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of diseases. Together, let's protect our crops and ensure a healthier harvest!

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
    3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - **Accuracy:** Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate disease detection.
    - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
    - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

    ### Get Started
    Click on the **Disease Recognition** page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Plant Disease Recognition System!

    ### About Us
    Learn more about the project, our team, and our goals on the **About** page.
